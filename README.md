This is a script I wrote to reset our Home PC's LAN card. Old intel PC's have a problem with their LAN connections getting disrupted on wake up. A simple solution is to open device-manager and reset the network-adapter.
Automation is to execute a script automatically on wake up with elevated priviliges to do that.
. Here's the one you can try out if you have similar troubles. Make sure to replace the device ID with your own LAN card's device ID[ you can find it by scrolling through the list generated in admin shell by the following command "pnputil /enum-devices" without the quotes, of course.
